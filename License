### 3. Set Up a License

Add a LICENSE file to your repository to specify the terms under which your project is distributed. You can choose a license from [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/).

### 4. Set Up Continuous Integration (CI)

Consider setting up a CI pipeline to automatically test your code on each push. GitHub Actions is a popular choice for this.

1. **Create a Workflow File:**
   - Create a file named `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in your repository.

2. **Add a Basic Workflow:**
   ```yaml
   name: CI

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main ]

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v2
           with:
             node-version: '14'
         - run: npm install
         - run: npm test
